# Django Examples

The Django examples are taken from:

+ tutorial

The official Django Documentation; this turns out to be suprisingly readable.

+ blog

The Try Django 1.9 playlist, over at [CodingEntrepreneurs](https://www.youtube.com/user/CodingEntrepreneurs). I recommend this tutorial as Justin's explanations are excellent and he is very active in the comments section answering viewers' comments.

# Setup

I running Python 3.5 on a windows 10 machine, using an Anaconda virtual environment. I tried using Pip on a windows box, but it was painful.
