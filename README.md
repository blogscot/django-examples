# Django Examples

The Django examples are taken from:

+ tutorial

The ***Official Django Documentation***; this turns out to be surprisingly readable.

+ blog

I started with ***Try Django 1.9*** playlist over at [CodingEntrepreneurs](https://www.youtube.com/user/CodingEntrepreneurs). 
 
I thoroughly recommend this tutorial as Justin's explanations are excellent and he is very active in the comments section answering viewers' questions.

Next up, the ***Advancing the Blog*** playlist, also at CodingEntrepreneurs, adds a big dose of professionalism to the introductory app.

# Setup

I'm running Python 3.5 on a Windows 10 machine, using an Anaconda virtual environment; this works pretty nicely.

# Hosting

For the curious, you can find the blog application [here](http://blogscot.pythonanywhere.com/) .
